# Final Presentation Instructions and Rubric

Once your implementation is ready, you will produce a polished 5 minute presentation of your working application. Your audience is your client (me). Assume that your client (me) brought 40 members of his team (all of you) with him to view the final presentation.

This is where you get to shine. Many final presentations just stagger me. By now you will know how to make a great presentation for the target audience.

## Requirements

Your 5 minute final presentation Loom video will include:

1) A demonstration of you compiling and launching your application from a terminal window.
2) A run-through of your working (compiled/running) application that demonstrates every screen and logging on as both a user and an administrator.
3) A comparison of your final application's user interface and your Marvel UI design. Switch between your application and Marvel for each comparison. Explain why or why not your implementation met your design and what you learned from that. In real life, when your mockup does not match your final implementation, your client may be upset... it's like an architect designing a soaring skyscraper and the builder delivers a large tent. If your final work does not match your design, own it and learn from it. 
4) Share the link to your Loom video in your GitHub repo. Make sure the link is public.
   - If necessary, create two Loom videos (the Free version limits each to 5 minutes). In the first, include the compilation, launch, and run-through. In the second, show the live comparison with Marvel.

### Submission Steps

The entire team will work execute the final presentation EFFORT. *All of you need* to review the completed video. This is a team effort and the team will succeed or fail as a group.

You have worked hard to get here. Show off your work and be proud of what you accomplished. Put some real effort and polish into your presentation to get your client excited about what you produced.

Your submission must include:

- a link to your team's final presentation video(s) [two maximum]. This video must show you starting and running your application, plus a side-by-side comparison of your completed application to your Marvel prototype along with an explanation of any discrepancy's between design and implementation.
- Your team's video presentation link(s) must be visible on your team's main `~\README.md` in the `Final Presentation` section.

### Grading Rubric

#### Component Percentages

1.  Final Presentation - 100%
    - Compile and launch from a terminal (5% penalty for starting from an IDE)
    - Application run-through (user and admin) of all functionality
    - Live comparison of each feature between Marvel UI Design and the actual implementation
    - One to two 5-minute public Loom videos

#### Final Presentation (100% of total)

-  90 to 100%: meets all requirements, well-recorded, well-organized, and highly professional. Polished work gets the top grade.
-  80% to 89%: meets all requirements, may have some recording or organizational issues.
-  70% to 79%: meets most requirements, may have some recording or organizational issues.
-  69% or below: does not meet most requirements or is very poorly recorded.

*Note: Presentations posted to GitHub will not be graded.* 

### Academic Honesty

Your work must be your own. Do not plagiarize under any circumstances. All work is subject to review by TurnItIn, etc.

More importantly, this course is a waste of your time if you do not do the work yourself. If you are tempted to cheat, you need to ask yourself why you are here and what you hope to accomplish in your career if you get the grade, but have minimal ability to perform the work after you leave the University.

### Team Grading

Everyone on the team will receive the same grade with one exception. It follows.

Anyone not participating in the project may be removed from the team and have to perform the project alone. Before anyone can be "fired" from a team, I must meet with the *entire team* and hear what is happening. Do not fire anyone from your team without my explicit prior agreement.
